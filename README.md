# Node-Express-Mysql-Sequelize
 This project is a robust and scalable API built on Node.js and Express.js, powered by MySQL for data storage and Sequelize as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool. The API serves as a foundation for creating powerful and performant server-side applications, handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for various resources.
